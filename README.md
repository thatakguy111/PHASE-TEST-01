# PHASE-TEST-01
Initial phase assessment. Executable constraints evident.

This repository contains the source code for a software system or component undergoing initial phase testing in a highly constrained virtual environment. The software is specifically designed for this environment, with strict constraints on resources.

During testing, the software will be evaluated in a controlled virtual environment to ensure it meets its functional and non-functional requirements. The software is not compatible with standard hardware and operating systems, and specific configuration and resource requirements must be met to execute it within the constrained virtual environment.

Documentation to set up the constrained virtual environment and execute the software is under process and due to be released. Due to the highly constrained nature of the software, all changes must be carefully reviewed and tested to ensure they do not introduce new constraints or negatively impact performance.

Please note that the software is not intended for use in standard systems and will not function properly outside of the constrained virtual environment. Users are encouraged to carefully evaluate the software's capabilities and limitations before deploying it in a production environment.

Known dependencies include:

* `libcustom.so` version 1.2.3
* `util-linux` version 2.36.2
